# weight-inspect

Inspect GGUF, safetensors, and ONNX model files to see architecture, tensor shapes, dtypes, quantization, and metadata.

Quickly answer:
- What model architecture is this?
- What quantization is used?
- What are the tensor shapes?
- How does this compare to another model?

Also provides a deterministic structural fingerprint to verify if two models have the same structure.

## The Problem

Model files are opaque blobs. When you download or convert a model, you can't easily see what's inside.

## The Solution

weight-inspect reads model file headers and shows you the structure — tensor names, shapes, dtypes, metadata — without loading any weight data.

This lets you:
- See what's in any model file
- Compare two models
- Get a deterministic fingerprint to verify structural identity

## Quick Start

```bash
weight-inspect summary model.gguf   # Quick glance (for scripts)
weight-inspect inspect model.gguf   # Full structure details
weight-inspect id model.gguf       # Stable fingerprint
weight-inspect diff a.gguf b.gguf  # Compare two models
```

## Installation

```bash
cargo install weight-inspect
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### ONNX Support

ONNX support is optional. To enable:

```bash
cargo install weight-inspect --features onnx
# or
cargo build --release --features onnx
```

## Usage Examples

### Get a fingerprint

```bash
$ weight-inspect id model.gguf
Structural identity
──────────────────
ID:        wi:gguf:3:9c1f3d2a
Stable:    yes (machine independent)
Includes:  header, tensor names, shapes, dtypes
Excludes:  raw weight bytes

format: GGUF
structural_hash: 9c1f3d2a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1
tensor_count: 291
metadata_count: 12
```

### One-line summary (for scripting/CI)

```bash
$ weight-inspect summary model.gguf
gguf,3,291,12,9c1f3d2a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1
```

`summary` is designed to fit on a single line and be safe for scripting, CI pipelines, and automation.

### Inspect full details

```bash
$ weight-inspect inspect model.gguf --verbose

```

### Compare two files

```bash
$ weight-inspect diff a.gguf b.gguf
DIFFERENT
--------------------
Added tensors:    2
Removed tensors:  0
Modified tensors: 3
Structural ID:    changed

Tensor changes
─────────────
  blk.12.attn.wq.weight
    dtype: f16 -> q4_k
    shape: [4096, 4096] -> [4096, 5120]
  blk.18.mlp.up_proj
    dtype: f16 -> q4_k
  output.weight
    shape: [32000, 4096] -> [32000, 5120]
```

Or for PR comments:

```bash
$ weight-inspect diff a.gguf b.gguf --format md
## Structural Diff

**Status:** [DIFFERENT]

| Change Type | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Added tensors | 2 |
| Removed tensors | 0 |
| Modified tensors | 3 |
```

### Compare with exit codes (CI)

```bash
# Exit code 0 if identical, 1 if different
weight-inspect diff a.gguf b.gguf --fail-on-diff
```

### Show only changes

```bash
weight-inspect diff a.gguf b.gguf --only-changes
```

### Verbose output

```bash
weight-inspect inspect model.gguf --verbose
weight-inspect diff a.gguf b.gguf --verbose
```

### HTML output (for visualization)

```bash
weight-inspect inspect model.gguf --html > inspection.html
```

### JSON output (for tooling)

```bash
$ weight-inspect id model.gguf --json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "format": "gguf",
  "structural_hash": "2de46f849506b6a34b02d75796396ab6e1b9e24844a732de2a498463aa98376d",
  "tensor_count": 0,
  "metadata_count": 22
}
```

## What it does

- Parses GGUF and safetensors headers
- Extracts metadata (hyperparameters, tokenizer config, etc.)
- Lists tensor names, dtypes, and shapes
- Computes structural hash (deterministic JSON → SHA256)
- Compares two files showing structural differences
- Unknown or unsupported fields are surfaced explicitly and do not silently affect identity

Structural hashes are versioned implicitly by format and canonicalization rules.

## Library Usage

weight-inspect is also available as a Rust library for programmatic use:

```rust
use weight_inspect::{gguf, hash, types::Artifact};

let file = std::fs::File::open("model.gguf")?;
let mut reader = std::io::BufReader::new(file);
let artifact = gguf::parse_gguf(&mut reader)?;
let structural_hash = hash::compute_structural_hash(&artifact)?;

println!("Hash: {}", structural_hash);
```

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
weight-inspect = "0.1"
```

For ONNX support:

```toml
[dependencies]
weight-inspect = { version = "0.1", features = ["onnx"] }
```

### API Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `gguf` | Parse GGUF model files |
| `safetensors` | Parse safetensors files |
| `onnx` | Parse ONNX files (with `features = ["onnx"]`) |
| `hash` | Compute structural hashes |
| `types` | Core types: `Artifact`, `Tensor`, `CanonicalValue` |
| `diff` | Compare artifacts |

## What it does NOT do

- **Never loads weight data** - Only reads headers and tensor descriptors
- Execute models
- Predict runtime compatibility
- Security scanning

### Why no weight data?

We intentionally only read headers/metadata because:

- **Fast**: Works on huge models without loading gigabytes
- **Memory safe**: No memory spikes on large files
- **Cross-platform**: Deterministic across any machine
- **Structural focus**: Answer "are these the same model?" not "are these identical files?"

If you need content equality (byte-for-byte), that's a separate mode that would require loading all weights.

## Design Principles

1. **Deterministic**: Same input → same output across machines
2. **Canonical**: Floats serialized as bit patterns, maps sorted
3. **No heuristics**: Pure structural comparison
4. **Fail fast**: Invalid files produce clear errors
5. **Stable output**: The same input file will always produce identical output across runs and machines

See [SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md) for full specification.

## Diff Output

Diffs are grouped by *type of structural change* rather than interpreted for semantic impact.

Use `--format md` for markdown output suitable for PR comments.

## Use cases

- "What model is this?" - Get instant structural identity
- "Is this the same model?" - Compare structural hashes
- "Why are these two models different?" - See exact differences
- Verify model file integrity
- Compare quantization variants
- Detect structural changes in converted models

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support for more formats (PyTorch .pt, TensorFlow .pb)
- [ ] Configurable hash inputs (include/exclude metadata)
- [ ] Output format plugins
- [ ] Git-like status porcelain

## Stability Guarantees

- **Output ordering**: Alphabetically sorted (BTreeMap)
- **Hash versioning**: Schema field in JSON output for future compatibility
- **Breaking changes**: Will bump major version in CLI and JSON schema
- **CI-safe**: Use `--fail-on-diff` for exit codes

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but please note:

- Output stability and determinism are prioritized over new features
- Changes that affect identity or ordering require discussion before PR
- Please run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before submitting
